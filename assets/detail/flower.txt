Flowers@@Flowers, and the bees' ability to harvest nectar and pollen from them, are vital to the colony's survival. When a bee visits a flower, the bee gathers nectar, some of which it stores and some of which it uses as a food source to fly to its next flower, and pollen, which is gathered on special "pollen baskets" on the bees' rear legs. Pollen and nectar are brought back to the hive and stored in special hexagonal cells, and the bees use these as food stores; part of this storage process transforms the nectar into honey! This all sounds well and good for the bees, but how do the flowers benefit?@@@#assets\image\bee3.jpg,512,384#@As the bees wander from flower to flower, some of the pollen they collect falls off on the flower! This is actually how flowers reproduce; the pollen from each flower contains some genetic material from the flower; if it lands on a suitable receiving organ of another flower, called a pistil, it fertilizes the plant, allowing it to produce seeds! These seeds eventually fall off (or are carried away by some other method), germinate, and new flowering plants grow. The circle of life continues!@@It's therefore very important to the flower that hungry bees are directed to the right spots, where the bees can find nectar and pollen can fall off onto the pistil. To this end, flowers have rather elaborate markings that guide the incoming bees like an airplane landing strip. As bees can see in the ultraviolet end of the spectrum, some of these landing strips, called 'pollen guides', may not be visible to the human eye. The image below shows an example of these pollen guides; it is not visible under normal light on the left, but on the right, it can be seen as a dark strip down the middle of the flower.@#assets\image\pollenguide.jpg,740,446#
