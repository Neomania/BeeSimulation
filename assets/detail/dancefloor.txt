Bee Dancing@@As the simulation shows, bees communicate to each other not by any sort of audible language, but through dance! There are two dances shown in this simulation, called the Waggle Dance and the Round Dance.@@^assets\video\waggledance.mpg,262,192^Waggle dance video (click to play, 0:55)@@The Waggle Dance is the more sophisticated of the two dances. As shown in the video above, a bee can indicate how far away from the hive a food source is, and what direction the food source is in. From this information, other bees which have never seen a particular food source before can find it on their first try.@@The information conveyed by the bee's dance is reflected in the simulation; the direction it moves in shows the food source's direction relative to the hive, and the length of its run shows how far away it is. In real life, bees also convey information about how profitable a food source is by waggling more vigorously; if multiple bees are dancing, they may compete to see who can get the most excited about their food source. While this isn't shown in the simulation, information about the profitability of a food source is conveyed to other virtual bees, and they will choose their next destination accordingly.@@@#assets\image\waggledanceangle.jpg,400,317#@In real life, dance floors aren't arranged around the hive like they are here. Real dance floors are vertical sections of comb; instead of dancing towards the food source, bees will convey an angle from the Sun. Sounds complicated? It is! Bees use the vertical upwards direction to represent the position of the Sun, then dance in a direction respective to the vertical that represents the angle between the Sun and their food source on the horizontal plane. Bees dancing for a long time will even adjust their dancing direction to compensate for the Sun's movement through the sky!@@Round Dancing@@#assets\image\dances.jpg,419,259#Round dances are the simpler of the two; if a food source is near enough to the hive, a bee will simply move in a circular pattern, which informs other bees that they should look around the hive. In the simulation, you might notice a bee whizzing around in a circle on a dance floor! While this isn't exactly what a true Round dance looks like, it's definitely different enough from a waggle dance to tell the difference!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@^assets\video\groove.mpg,480,360^Dance on, bees!
