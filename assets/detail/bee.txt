Bees@#assets\image\bee.jpg,330,330#This is a honeybee! In this simulation, the simple honeybee leaves the hive, gathers nectar and pollen from flowers, and makes its way back home. Once it's home, it might hear about other food sources from other bees, or perform a dance and tell other bees about one it found! Then it sets out again, bringing more pollen home, and so on.@@In real life, honeybees might spend about 20 days as foragers, which may not sound like much, but is in fact about half their entire lives! On average, a single honeybee will only make about a twelfth of a teaspoon of honey; up to 2,000,000 flowers may be accessed by bees in order to make just a pound of honey.@@Only worker bees are simulated here; in real life, worker bees comprise just one of the three castes of bees that may be present in a hive, and in their first 20 or so days (before setting out to forage), worker bees can take on many roles and perform many jobs. Comb building, hive guarding and nursing developing bees are just some of the many things a worker bee may do.@@Royalty@@#assets\image\queenbee.jpg,300,234#You may know the other castes of bees as queens and drones! The purpose of the queen is primarily to act as the hive's mother; only the queen bee and the drones she mates with have fully-functional reproductive organs. Interestingly, queen bees are not different from worker bees at birth; they turn out that way due to being fed only royal jelly throughout their development.@@A queen bee does not oversee the hive directly; she may secrete pheromones which act as chemical messages to bees, but otherwise the workers are mostly self-managed, working with each other to keep the hive alive.@@#assets\image\dronebee.jpg,600,400#Drones are the only male bees in the hive. Their only purpose is to mate with queens, a process which in fact kills them from exhaustion! Otherwise, they will do nothing but sit around and eat honey all day. No surprise then, that in times of food shortage, such as during winter, they are sometimes kicked out of the hive by the rest of the colony!
