The Hive@@#assets\image\beehive.jpg,700,467#@Home sweet home! The beehive serves as a base of operation for bees. Worker bees will tirelessly harvest pollen and nectar, then bring it back here for storage. This food is used to help rear up new bees, and feeds the bees through times of food shortage. Did you know pure honey never spoils, due to its high sugar content? A single hive can house up to 80,000 bees depending on the time of year; luckily for your computer, this simulation takes that down to a handful or so.@@Hives are constructed out of combs, composed of naturally hexagonal chambers (cells). Some cells are used for storing food, and others are used to rear young. Special enlarged cells are even used to rear queens, possibly the most important bees in the hive! The cells are constructed out of beeswax, which comes from an abdominal gland on worker bees. Dance floors, located around the hive in our simulation, are also constructed of beeswax; these hang vertically.
